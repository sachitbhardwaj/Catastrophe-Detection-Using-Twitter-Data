# Catastrophe Detection Using Twitter Data

In this project, over 11,000 tweets associated with disaster keywords are used to predict catastrophe depicting tweets through machine learning and natural language techniques.
This project is performed in 3 major steps. The dataset is prepared for training through various layers of preprocessing and this preprocessed data is trained through various models. 
These trained models are evaluated on the basis of 4 evaluation metrics.
